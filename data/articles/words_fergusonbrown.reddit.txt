This
should
the
top
comment
That
s
the
mantra
of
the
ghetto
black
community
they
blame
everything
under
the
sun
except
their
own
actions
Ferguson
is
now
dead
People
are
going
to
move
away
they
say
outsiders
are
the
ones
destroying
things
well
why
aren
t
the
citizens
stopping
them
The
media
doesn
t
care
they
will
go
home
to
their
own
towns
and
they
are
there
because
we
watch
from
the
safety
of
our
homes
The
real
irony
here
is
that
the
very
people
who
claim
to
be
left
out
of
the
economic
growth
are
burning
down
the
very
places
that
may
hire
them
A
job
at
auto
zone
could
turn
into
a
job
at
a
car
dealership
or
a
mechanics
position
in
the
future
A
job
at
arbys
can
turn
into
a
bartenders
positiin
Its
fucked
up
and
no
one
will
say
it
out
loud
but
a
lot
of
these
people
think
its
fun
to
do
this
crap
And
eventually
the
fires
are
gonna
burn
out
and
the
black
people
who
live
there
are
just
gonna
be
sitting
in
the
ashes
with
less
options
and
more
police
Who
will
then
continue
to
blame
socioeconomics

around

bitching
about
the

in
one
area
even
as
firetrucks
and
police
cruisers
rushed
to
the
scene
of
a
fire
right
in
front
of
their
minivan
Then
she
blames
all
the
gunshots
and
looting
on
police
provocateurs
Then
she
complains
about
the
presence
of
too
many
cops
defending
a
major

how
the

Everyone
here
on
who
is
in
the
Michael
Brown
Fan
Club
You
claim
you
want
justice
so
what
are
you
protesting
now
Justice
was
done
There
won
t
be
a
public
trial
in
America
we
don
t
put
people
on
trial
just
to
satisfy
the
vengeance
of
the
mob
We
don
t
bring
someone
up
on
charges
if
the
facts
do
not
support
those
charges
Michael
Brown
was
not
and
is
not
a
civil
rights
hero
he
was
a
belligerent
and
violent
young
man
who
lost
his
life
because
of
his
own
actions
It
is
sad
that
he
s
dead
and
it
s
his
fault
that
he
s
dead
He
sought
an
altercation
with
a
store
clerk
and
then
he
sought
an
altercation
with
a
cop
In
the
course
of
that
second
altercation
he
tried
to
grab
the
officer
s
gun
And
now
he
s
dead
That
s
what
happens
when
you
assault
a
cop
and
try
to
take
his
gun
You
get
shot
This
is
no
great
mystery
It
s
no
cause
for
rioting
in
the
streets
It
s
a
case
where
A
B
C
and
Michael
Brown
is
fully
responsible
Those
of
you
continuing
to
support
Michael
Brown
This
decision
is
not
what
you
wanted
but
that
s
only
because
you
never
wanted
justice
at
all
You
wanted
a
certain
outcome
and
you
have
demanded
that
outcome
from
the
very
beginning
before
listening
to
the
other
side
before
looking
at
the
evidence
before
hearing
from
all
of
the
witnesses
before
giving
the
dust
a
chance
to
settle
You
came
to
a
conclusion
based
on
rumor
and
conjecture
and
you
have
not
strayed
from
that
conclusion
or
adjusted
it
or
even
acknowledged
that
any
other
conclusions
are
possible
This
is
not
the
behavior
of
people
who
want
justice
and
fairness
This
is
the
behavior
of
a
lynch
mob
This
is
the
behavior
of
tyrants
who
are
perfectly
willing
to
send
an
innocent
man
to
jail
if
it
means
winning
some
kind
of
bizarre
ideological
victory
This
is
behavior
that
ought
to
be
exposed
and
shamed
in
no
uncertain
terms
This
has
nothing
to
do
with
Racism
and
damn
the
media
and
the
people
out
there
saying
it
s
what
it
s
about

I
totally
agree
and
you
are
right
that
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
race
But
and
I
say
this

guy
so
experience
older
black
people
and
many
black
people
from
areas
like
Ferguson
have
this
weird

you
re
black
I
m

help
each
other

Personally
I
find
it
very

I
ve
even
had
to
tell
people
I
don
t
know
you
people
nodding
at

because
I
m
the

The
moment
they
realize
you
aren

like
that
you
re
immediately
seen
as
an
uncle
tom
which
I
have
been
called

times

by
black

In
fact
the
most
racist
and
fucked
up
shit
ever
said
to
me
was
from
other

Many
put
that
stock
into

color

make

So

The
hivemind
is
in
full
effect
here
so
bracing
for
an
inbox
beating
But
to
explain
rioting
happens
when
you
are
full
of
rage
and
no
logical
or
rational
outlets
appear
to
exist
to
release
it
Everyone
is
focusing
on
SPECIFICALLY
just
this
case
Riots
don
t
happen
over
a
single
shooting
Riots
are
a
symptom
of
a
disease
that
festers
untreated
for
a
long
long
time
The
real
issue
harassment
of
citizens
by
people
sworn
to
protect
them
specifically
treating
minorities
as
if
they
are
assumed
guilty
and
need
to
prove
innocence
see
NYC
s
stop
and
frisk
laws
This
is
a
real
issue
that
has
been
systematically
underplayed
ignored
or
even
supported
by
the
justice
system
and
law
enforcement
Many
people
deny
that
this
harassment
and
violence
by
law
enforcement
even
exists
as
an
issue
See
for
example
most
comments
in
this
thread
When
communities
can
t
even
get
a
major
issue
recognized
as
an
issue
at
all
rage
explodes
and
has
no
proper
legal
outlet
The
courts
won
t
help
the
politicians
won
t
help
and
the
cops
won
t
help
What
is
left
after
all
logical
recourse
is
gone
Riots
are
illogical
rage
explosions
when
all
hope
is
lost
Understanding
them
isn
t
a
justification
of
them
But
to
offhandedly
dismiss
them
as
ignorant
stupid
illogical
etc
is
to
continue
to
ignore
a
festering
disease
Doesn
t
that
illogical
action
sound
like
the
action
of
desperate
people
out
of
solutions
It
s
tragic

Honestly
if
you
look
at
any
riot
ever
this
is
exactly
why
they
were
rioting
Think
French
Revolution
Think
Rodney
King
Think
even
of
the
Boston
Tea
Party
They
all
happened
because
the
system
either
ignored
or
supported
the
disenfranchisement
of
these
groups
of
people
they
had
no
other
outlet

condemning

riots

he
did
understand
them
and
where
they
were
coming
from
and
he
refused

play
the
hypocritical
game
of
denouncing
them
You

Please
remember
that
indicting
someone
is
not
the
same
as
assessing
guilt
An
indictment
just
means
that
there
should
be
a
trial
It
doesn
t
say
that
Wilson
is
guilty
nor
does
it
say
he
is
innocent
It
just
says
that
there
is
some
possibility
that
a
crime
may
have
been
committed
The
requirement
for
an
indictment
does
not

beyond

I
ll
be
honest
and
say
that
is
has
only
gotten
worse
the
last
few
decades
I
know
blaming
thug
culture
is
old
but
Fuck
thug
culture
It
s
not
a
beautiful
expression
of
oppression
it
s
a
poison

As
more
information
comes
out
I
feel
like
a
total
dumbass
for
actually
thinking
this
Kid
was
innocent
at
first
It
s
just
ridiculous
that
the
cops
are
the
bad
guys
when
this
thug
mugs
a
store
owner
and
assaults
a
cop
and
is
considered
the
good
guy
of
the
situation

Because
you
have
the

superior
to
that
of
a
turnip
Of
course
the
problem
is
that
you
are
thinking
about
this
thing
logically

The
amount
of
white
guilt
and
riot
apologist
on
my
FB
newsfeed
is
leading
me
to
quit
social

Pardoning
this
type
of
behavior
is
perpetuating
stereotypes
and
does
no

for
all
of
us

As
an
outsider
looking
in
I
just
have
to
say
this
is
getting
pathetic
I
don
t
like
cops
who
fire
their
weapons
a
bit
too
liberally
either
but
to
start
rioting
in
the
streets
and
destroying
other
peoples
property
is
just
pathetic
If
you
re
going
to
hurt
someone
hurt
the
ones
involved
not
some
poor
shop
owner
who
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
I
don
t
care
how
you
look
at
it
this
kind
of
behavior
is
not
acceptable
in
the
slightest

Hey
I
have
a
bright
idea
Instead
of
joining
as
a
community
to
help
each
other
let
s
just
fuck
up
everything
we
can
because
we
re
mad
Hundreds
of
people
acting
like
children
throwing
tantrums
Instead
of
protecting
correcting
you
destroy
hundreds
of
thousands
if
not
millions
by
the
time
this
is
order
of
dollars
of
properties
of
people
who
have
NOTHING
to
do
with
this
The
MOST
you
are
doing
is
causing
the
police
more
paper
work
They
won
t
pay
for
those
repairs
A
lot
of
insurance
companies
won
t
either
due
to
the
circumstances
Congratulations
on
showing
exactly
why
there
are
still
stereotypes
in
this
countries
Congratulations
on
showing
why
humans
still
suck
Your
not
a
community
combined
in
trying
to
help
repair
a
damaged
system
Your
a
group
of
idiots
finding
any
reason
to
go
crazy
Thanksgiving
is
this
week
Christmas
is
right
around
the
corner
That
cop
your
pissed
at
He
s
not
going
to
be
suffering
like
the
hundreds
of
families
that
have
been
fucked
over
by
you
people
Happy
holidays

I
work
at
a
place
where
everyone
EVERYONE
is
asking
for
my
fucking
opinion
and
it
seems
universally
that
if
I
don
t
agree
that
Michael
Brown
was
murdered
without
cause
I
m
a
racist
I
m
going
to
pull
a
Homer
Simpson
and
just
walk
away
But
seriously
can
someone
point
me
in
the
direction
of
where
I
can
look
at
the
evidence
without
a
biased
viewpoint
I
d
like
to
be
able
to
make
up
my
own
conclusions
and
not
be
forced
to
potentially
be
marked
a
racist
at
my
workplace

A
friend
of
mine
is
a
cop
and
he
mentioned
this
is
a
perfect
case
of
requiring
lapel
cameras
on
cops
He
s
not
afraid
to
wear
one
at
all
His
reasoning
was
itll
make
me
and
everyone
else
stay
on
their
A
game
and
all
the
evidence
in
the
world
for
your
own
actions
Worse
case
scenario
you
weed
out
the
bad
cops
Now
if
they
d
just
pay
cops
more
it
might
attract
better
