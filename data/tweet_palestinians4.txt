I don't understand why u call palestinians "terrorist" or wtvr it's their land why israel came and killed them? EDUCATE YOURSELF. #Palestine
I am weeping for #Jerusalem &amp; #Israel. Such evil. Saddened by #Palestinians celebrating the #Rabbi murders by holding axes &amp; sharing candy.
Obama "But both Palestinians &amp; Israelis want peace." Yea as they plummeted Israel with close to 4,000 rockets, mowing down w/cars,butchering
Opression creates violence. This is the status of Palestinians in their homeland &amp; in diaspora #Palestine #Israel
The irony of self-determination is that Palestinians aren't allowed to determine for themselves. They must go through Israel.
